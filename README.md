# Fork of Jeremy Wimbledom JeoPHPardy

This is a simple PHP/Javascript Jeopardy-like board that I've used to run some trivia games in the PHP community.

It has suited my needs well, along with my [Wireless Eggspert buzzer system](http://www.amazon.com/Educational-Insights-Wireless-Eggspert-2-4G/dp/B001ZMZK7A/), and I've had requests that I publish the source, so that they could use it as well. I can't offer any guarantees that it'll work though, since I have put absolutely no work into making it work anywhere but on my computer and for my needs.

If you end up using it and making any improvements, please consider sending me a PR.

## Requirements

This is what I used to develop/run the game. It may work in other browsers or operating systems, but I have not tested it anywhere but my laptop.

- Mac OS X Mavericks
- Google Chrome (up-to-date)
- PHP 5.4+ w/ built-in PHP server
- Fonts (download, install, and license yourself)
    - [ITC Korinna Bold](http://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/Korinna+Bold/)
    - [Gyparody](http://www.1001fonts.com/gyparody-font.html)

## Features

- Supports 5 categories
- Supports 5 question levels (e.g., 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000)
- Questions are loaded from a PHP array
- Base score can be configured, so that Double Jeopardy rounds can be scheduled
- Scoreboard with 6 players
- Players can be named
- On question screen, players can be given points (or have points taken away)
  by clicking on their name (or shift+clicking for negative). There is also a
  skull button which is used to reveal the answer if no player gets it correct.
- There is one Daily Double randomly assigned to one of the $800 or $1000
  dollar questions.
- Final Jeopardy is supported, but is a separate file.

## Limitations

- There is always 6 players
- There is always 1 Daily Double
- I wrote this code quickly, and I'm not very good with JavaScript.
- Don't refresh the page
- Final Jeopardy is a separate file and does not hook into the scores at all.
- No music or sound effects

## How to use

First you must create a round using `empty-round.php` as a template. It looks
like this:

```php
<?php return [
	'pointScale' => 200, // Change this to adjust point values
	'categories' => [
		[
			'name' => 'xx', // e.g., Potent Potables
			'questions' =>  [
				[
				 	'question' => 'xx', //e.g., This is my name.
				 	'answer'   => 'xx', //e.g., What is Jeremy?
				],
				[
				 	'question' => 'xx',
				 	'answer'   => 'xx',
				],
				[
				 	'question' => 'xx',
				 	'answer'   => 'xx',
				],
				[
				 	'question' => 'xx',
				 	'answer'   => 'xx',
				],
				[
				 	'question' => 'xx',
				 	'answer'   => 'xx',
				],
			]
		],
		// Repeated for each category...
```

Next, make sure `play.php` is set to load your round.

```php
$game = include 'my-round.php';
include 'template.php';
```

Then, start a PHP server in the directory containing the index.html, and go to
it in your browser. Yay!

## Final Jeopardy

To setup final jeopardy, create a file similar to my-round.php using final-empty.php as a template.
Then load it up in final.php by referencing it:

```php
$game = include 'my-final.php';
```

Finally, load up final.php in your browser and click anywhere in the screen
to proceed from category through to thanks.
